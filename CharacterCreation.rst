  - Agility

  - Strength
  - Melee Weapons

REACTION

SKILLS
------

- Skills represent training or special talent in specific areas of your Attributes.  
- Skills bonuses are added to your Attribute score when calculating your roll threshold.
- There is no set list of skills, these are specializations that you create for yourself inspired by your background history

Example:

While the use of ranged weapons is already covered by Reaction, one could choose to have specific training in Firearms, and allow extra points to be added to rolls involving guns. This bonus would not apply when using bows or slingshots however.

TRAITS
------

Traits are special abilities that your character has, which can be activated when in danger to give an Advantage. 

Some traits have an AP cost to activate or sustain, while others simply add features to your character

General Price Guide:

- Traits granting a flat boost to skills may exchange 1 Trait point per Skill point (Example: Eagle-Eyed giving a +2 to Perception would cost 2 Trait Points)

- Traits granting new abilities that have a minimal impact on combat have a negotiable cost of between 2 to 5 Trait Points (Example: Thermal Vision [2 TP], Telepathy [3 TP], Water Breathing [5 TP])

- Traits granting new abilities that do impact combat tend to have a Trait fee to buy and a Stamina fee to use (Example: Flight [10 AP] [20 TP], Accelerated Healing [10 AP] [20 TP], Super Strength [5 AP] [10 TP]

- Abilities that can directly be used as weapons such as energy projection or natural weapons such as claws cost Trait points equal to their Weapon Rating (Example: Bone Claws [7 TP] [7 WR]

GEAR
----

Gear Points may be spent during character creation to purchase equipment that is signature to your character. This includes things like signature armour, weapons, gadgets, and vehicles

ASPECTS
